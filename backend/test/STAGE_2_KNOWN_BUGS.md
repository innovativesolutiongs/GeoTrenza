# Stage 2 Known Bugs

Bugs in `backend/ingestion/` that the Stage 2 rewrite will fix. Each bug
has a regression test under `backend/test/parsers/` that locks current
behavior — so when the fix lands, the test fails and is updated in the
same commit. This document is the cross-reference between bugs, tests,
and fix commits.

## Bug 1 — `parseLocationExtra` field names don't match writer expectations  🟢

**File:** `backend/ingestion/utils/locationExtraParser.js`

**Expected behavior:** The parser should emit field names that match what
`ingestion/index.js` (the writer) reads when it builds the database row.
Three pairs were mismatched, so the writer read `undefined` and the
column landed as NULL even though the parser decoded a real value.

**Pre-fix behavior:**

| Parser emitted (`locationExtraParser.js`) | Writer reads (`index.js`) | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `signalStrength` | `gsmSignal` | Silently dropped |
| `battery` | `batteryVoltage` | Silently dropped |
| `speedExtra` | `extendedSpeed` | Silently dropped |

`mileage`, `fuel`, `satellites` matched on both sides and were not affected.

**Test that locks this:** `backend/test/parsers/locationExtra.test.js`,
"synthetic TLV input — verifies field names match writer reads". The
test now asserts the post-fix names.

**Fix commit:** `64db5c3` — renamed the three parser fields to match
the writer's spelling. The new schema's `positions.telemetry` jsonb
column uses the writer's names too, so the fix aligns parser/writer/
schema at once.

## Bug 2 — `parseLocationExtra` hardcoded offset 70 (TLVs actually at 82)  🟢

**File:** `backend/ingestion/utils/locationExtraParser.js`, line 7
(`let start = 82` after the fix)

**Expected behavior:** TLV extras in a JT/T 808 0x0200 location-report
packet begin **after** the BCD timestamp field. Packet body layout:

| Offset | Bytes | Field |
|--------|-------|-------|
| 22–25  | 4     | message serial |
| 26–33  | 8     | alarm |
| 34–41  | 8     | status |
| 42–49  | 8     | latitude |
| 50–57  | 8     | longitude |
| 58–61  | 4     | altitude |
| 62–65  | 4     | speed |
| 66–69  | 4     | direction |
| **70–81** | **12** | **BCD timestamp (YYMMDDHHMMSS)** |
| **82+** | variable | **TLV extras begin here** |

The parser should read TLVs starting at offset **82**, not 70.

**Pre-fix behavior:** Parser hardcoded `start = 70`, so it ate 12
characters of BCD timestamp bytes as TLV id+length pairs and emitted
`unknown_XX` keys for them. The real TLVs that came after were
*sometimes* recovered correctly (if the misread byte count happened to
align) and *sometimes* lost (if alignment shifted).

**Test that locks this:** `backend/test/parsers/locationExtra.test.js`,
"deviceSimulator packet #3 — verifies post-fix TLV decoding from offset
82". Test asserts the post-fix output `{mileage: 0, unknown_30,
unknown_31, unknown_E1}` — note that the three `unknown_*` entries are
real TLVs that `parseExtraMessages` handles (see Bug 5);
`parseLocationExtra` correctly ignores them via its default branch.

**Fix commit:** TBD (filled in by follow-up commit) — hardcoded `82`
with a comment explaining the timestamp offset. The alternative
(reading offset from the message body length header) was considered
but rejected as overkill for a device type that always sends the same
body layout.

## Bug 3 — `parseExtraMessages` same offset-70 bug as Bug 2  🔴

**File:** `backend/ingestion/utils/extraMessageParser.js`, line 4
(`let index = 70`)

**Expected behavior:** Same as Bug 2 — TLVs begin at offset 82, after
the BCD timestamp.

**Current behavior:** Same code-level bug as Bug 2, listed separately
because it's a separate file that needs its own fix. With the
deviceSimulator's packet #3, the misread is *partial*: the 12-char
timestamp misread happens to consume exactly the same number of bytes
as the real first TLV (mileage), so subsequent iterations realign with
the remaining real TLVs. `gsmSignal`, `satellites`, `batteryVoltage`
decode correctly *despite the bug*; `mileage` is lost and `unknown_23` +
`unknown_00` appear as parsing artifacts.

This partial-correctness is the likely reason no one noticed Bug 2 / Bug
3 in production — most fields reached the dashboard. Anyone diagnosing
"why is mileage always zero?" would have hit it.

**Test that locks this:** `backend/test/parsers/extraMessages.test.js`,
"Bug 3: deviceSimulator packet #3 — locks offset-70 partial-garbage
output".

**Planned fix commit:** TBD — same approach as Bug 2. Both parsers can
land in the same commit since they share the root cause; the tests for
both will need to be updated together.

## Bug 4 — `parseStatus` emits labels for "off" states, not just transitions  🔴

**File:** `backend/ingestion/utils/statusParser.js`

**Expected behavior:** Status flags should be recorded only when they
*change* (rising/falling edge), not every poll cycle. The new
`events.kind` column with `started_at` / `ended_at` is designed for
this transition model.

**Current behavior:** For bits 0–4 and bit 6, `parseStatus` has both
`if` and `else` branches and emits a label every call regardless of
whether the underlying flag changed. The 0x0200 handler in `index.js`
then writes one row to `gps_status_legacy` per emitted label, so the
table records "ACC OFF" / "GPS Not Fixed" / "Door Closed" as if they
were events.

Bits with this both-sides emission pattern: 0 (ACC ON/OFF), 1 (GPS
Fixed/Not Fixed), 2 (Latitude S/N), 3 (Longitude W/E), 4 (Vehicle
Running/Stopped), 6 (Door Open/Closed). Bits 5, 7, 8–10, 13 are
correctly emitted only when set.

**Test that locks this:** `backend/test/parsers/status.test.js`,
"decodes status value 3 (the actual value from deviceSimulator.js
packet #3)". The expected six-element output includes four
`else`-branch labels for bits that are off.

**Planned fix commit:** TBD — replace the parser's `if/else` emissions
with an object describing each flag's current state, and let the
0x0200 handler diff against the device's previous state to compute
transitions. Writes only on transition. The test will then expect
only `["ACC ON", "GPS Fixed"]` (the two bits that *are* set in value
3) and likely also require a device-state cache as test fixture.

## Bug 5 — `parseLocationExtra` / `parseExtraMessages` dual-parser source mismatch  🔴

**File:** `backend/ingestion/index.js`, lines 158–184 (the
`extraRepo.save({...})` block immediately after
`const extras = parseLocationExtra(hex)`)

**Expected behavior:** The writer's read keys should come from the
parser it just called. After `const extras = parseLocationExtra(hex)`,
every `extras.XXX` reference should map to a key that
`parseLocationExtra` actually emits. If a field is decoded by a
different parser (`parseExtraMessages`), the writer should consult
that parser's output instead.

**Current behavior:** The writer reads four keys from `extras` that
`parseLocationExtra` never emits — they're only decoded by
`parseExtraMessages` (or not at all):

| Writer reads (in `extraRepo.save`) | Where the value actually lives          |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `extras.alarmEvent`                | Nowhere — not emitted by either parser  |
| `extras.temperature`               | `parseExtraMessages` case `51` (÷10)    |
| `extras.fuelSensor`                | `parseExtraMessages` case `50`          |
| `extras.externalVoltage`           | `parseExtraMessages` case `61` (÷100)   |

Result: the corresponding columns in `gps_extra_location_legacy`
(`alarm_event`, `temperature`, `fuel_sensor`, `external_voltage`) have
been **always NULL in production** since launch, regardless of what
the device actually reports. This is the same root cause as the
"two parsers running over the same hex region" issue — formerly listed
under "Bugs not yet tracked" until this audit produced concrete
production impact.

**Test that locks this:** Not yet — this is a writer-side issue, so the
regression test belongs with the writer's tests when Stage 2 writes
them. The parser-level tests (`locationExtra.test.js`,
`extraMessages.test.js`) correctly capture that each parser emits its
own keys; the bug is in how the writer connects them.

**Planned fix commit:** TBD — two plausible paths:
1. Consolidate both parsers into a single TLV decoder (preferred —
   reduces surface area). The combined parser would emit one object
   with all decoded keys regardless of which "side" decoded them.
2. Merge the two parsers' outputs in `index.js` before the writer
   reads them: `const merged = { ...parseLocationExtra(hex),
   ...parseExtraMessages(hex) }`. Cheaper short-term fix but doesn't
   address the parser duplication.

## Bugs not yet tracked

The remaining known issue from `docs/current-state.md` that is NOT in
this list:

- **Speed-triggered engine-immobilizer** — already disabled in Stage 0
  (commented out in `ingestion/index.js`). Stage 4 redesigns with the
  four-condition safeguard.

Add new bugs to this list as they're found. When a fix lands, replace
"TBD" with the commit SHA and flip the status emoji.
